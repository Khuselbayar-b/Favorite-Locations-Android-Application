# Favorite-Locations-Android-Application
Android application using Kotlin: a map that can be pinned to add a favorite location and its description. 

•	Used a public maps API to load up a map that can be pinned to add a favorite location and its description. Utilized Test Case-Base testing to debug and evaluate functionality of the system.
•	Embedded a local server on the app, sending and receiving HTTP requests; learned to filter and deal with invalid requests.
•	Utilized JSON to communicate with the server, deserializing and serializing objects. Learned to work with CSV format while testing the validity of the data.
